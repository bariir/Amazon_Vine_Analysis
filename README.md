- Amazon S3, Amazon managed Relational Database Service (RDS), PostgreSQL 12.10, pgAdmin, Spark 3.2.2,  Google Colab, and Git Bash to commit changes into GitHub Repository.


# Results
Jennifer’s goal is to analyze all the reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Jennifer and her colleague use latest cloud technologies to both store large amounts of dataset and transform and compute this data in short amount of time and provide the result of the analysis to the end user to make informed decisions.  Here are the steps taken by Jennifer and her colleague to analyze the data.

-	How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? <br>
With the large dataset I’ve used, there are 6,878 Vine reviews and 6,924,287 non-Vine reviews<br>

-	How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? <br>
With the large dataset that I used, there are 543 Vine reviews with 5 star ratings and 112,803 non-Vine reviews with 5 star ratings. <br>

-	What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? <br>
Percentage of paid Vine reviews with 5 stars were 0.4438305709023941 and percentage of non_Vine reviews with 5 stars were 0.4627093251066018<br>

# Summary
The analysis done by Jennifer and her colleague did not find many positive bias since the percentage of paid Vine reviews is very close to the percentage of unpaid reviews with 5 star ratings.
- Here are the two percentage results. <br>
